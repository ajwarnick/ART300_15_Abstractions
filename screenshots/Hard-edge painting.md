### Piet Mondrian

#### Bio:

**Pieter Cornelis Mondriaan** (7 March 1872 – 1 February 1944), was a Dutch [painter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Painting) and [theoretician](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_art) who is regarded as one of the greatest artists of the 20th century. He is known for being one of the pioneers of 20th century [abstract art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_art), as he changed his artistic direction from figurative painting to an increasingly abstract style, until he reached a point where his artistic vocabulary was reduced to simple geometric elements. ([From Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piet_Mondrian))

### Ad Reinhardt

#### Bio:

**Adolph Frederick "Ad" Reinhardt** (December 24, 1913 – August 30, 1967) was an [abstract painter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_art) active in New York beginning in the 1930s and continuing through the 1960s. He was a member of the [American Abstract Artists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Abstract_Artists) and was a part of the movement centered on the [Betty Parsons Gallery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betty_Parsons) that became known as [abstract expressionism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_expressionism). He was also a member of The Club, the meeting place for the New York School abstract expressionist artists during the 1940s and 1950s. He wrote and lectured extensively on art and was a major influence on [conceptual art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_art), [minimal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimalist) [art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art) and [monochrome painting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monochrome_painting). Most famous for his "black" or "ultimate" paintings, he claimed to be painting the "last paintings" that anyone can paint. He believed in a philosophy of art he called *Art-as-Art* and used his writing and satirical cartoons to advocate for [abstract art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_art) and against what he described as "the disreputable practices of artists-as-artists". ([From Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_Reinhardt))
